## Overview
In response to the need for more reliable language identification and language diarization systems, we present: the MERLIon CCS Challenge, the first ever challenge featuring audio recordings from the Talk Together Study, a unique first-of-its-kind Zoom videocall dataset. Aligning closely with [Interspeech 2023](https://www.interspeech2023.org/)’s theme, we present the challenge of developing robust language identification and language diarization systems that are reliable for non-standard accented, bilingual, child-directed speech collected via a videocall platform. 
With this challenge, we hope to test the robustness of existing language diarization systems, and to get the research community to propose novel solutions in terms of adaptation, training, and novel embedding extraction for this particular set of tasks.
